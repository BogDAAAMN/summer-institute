### Update: Due to the current public health situation, we are now holding SICSS-Rutgers virtually. Participants will watch pre-recorded instructional videos and attend live sessions for group discussion, hands-on activities, and guest talks.###

Participation is restricted to Ph.D. students, postdoctoral researchers, and untenured faculty. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, and especially encourage applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science and those whose research seeks to contribute to social progress (broadly conceived), particularly research related to the study of race, gender, sexuality, or systemic social and economic inequality. Note: You do not need to be affiliated with Rutgers to attend the institute. 

All applications will be given consideration, and we hope to assemble a diverse set of participants across many backgrounds and levels of expertise. We evaluate applicants along a number of dimensions: 1) research and teaching in the area of computational social science 2) contributions to public goods, such as creating open source software, curating public datasets, and creating educational opportunities for others 3) likelihood to benefit from participation 4) likelihood to contribute to the educational experience of other participants 5) potential to spread computational social science to new intellectual communities and areas of research, particularly research areas related to social progress (broadly conceived) and the study of race, gender, sexuality, or systemic social and economic inequality. Further, when making our evaluations, attempt to account for an applicantâ€™s career stage and previous educational opportunities.
<br />

The institute will take place during the day, on weekdays between June 15-26th. We expect participants to attend the full institute. If you anticipate a conflict with portions of the day or 1 or more full days of the institute, please just note this in your application.

Applicants must submit the following documents here: https://forms.gle/b1EoxXHF9xYLypMV9: 
<br />
(i) a curriculum vitae, (ii) a statement (maximum three pages) describing both any current research and your interest in computational social science, (iii) one writing sample (no more than 35 pages). Co-authored work is acceptable for the writing sample. The writing sample may, but does not have to, show familiarity with computational social science tools.

Please note: we have removed the requirement for a letter of recommendation for graduate students. We welcome all applicants and recognize it might not be feasible for everyone to acquire a letter. We encourage all applications!

**In order to be guaranteed full consideration, all application materials should be submitted by May 1, 2020. Applicants will be notified approximately 2 weeks after the deadline and will be asked to confirm their participation soon after that.

Inquiries can be sent to sicssrutgers@gmail.com.
